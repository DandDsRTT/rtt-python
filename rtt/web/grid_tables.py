# incorporates the cyan complexity list; see its entry. The domain basis P and generator
# basis B are yellow, so the primes and generators columns colour like the commas column.)

# error/damage chain 𝐞 = (𝒈𝑀 − 𝒋)T, which keeps every operand's factors
# (G, M, J, T) across the 𝒓 = 𝒕 − 𝒋 difference. A norm carries its operand's factors, so
# the complexity 𝒄 = ‖𝑋·v‖ inherits 𝑋 and the basis v's own colour. CELL_FACTORS lists
# only the colour-bearing factors of each tile; a (row, col) absent here carries no wash.
